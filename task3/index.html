      <h2>Theoretical Part</h2>
      <h3>1.1 IP address</h3>
      <p>
        It is a unique address that identifies a device on the internet or a
        local network. IP stands for "Internet Protocol," which is the set of
        rules governing the format of data sent via the internet or local
        network. First part of IP address is a network number and second part is
        a host number. 32bit number in IPv4 standard or 128bit number in IPv6.
        In essence, it is the identifier that allows information to be sent
        between devices on a network: they contain location information and make
        devices accessible for communication.
      </p>
      <p>
        IP is a connectionless, unreliable, best-effort delivery protocol. IP
        accepts whatever data is passed down to it from the upper layers and
        forwards the data in the form of IP Packets. All the nodes are
        identified using an IP address. Packets are delivered from the source to
        the destination using IP address
      </p>

      <h3>1.2 Network subnets</h3>
      <p>
        It is a logical subdivision of an IP network. To create subnet, Host ID
        is divided into Host ID and subnet ID.
      </p>
      <p>
        Computers that belong to the same subnet are addressed with an identical
        most-significant bit-group in their IP addresses. This results in the
        logical division of an IP address into two fields: the network number or
        routing prefix and the rest field or host identifier.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through subnetting, network traffic can travel a shorter distance
        without passing through unnecessary routers to reach its destination.
      </p>

      <h3>1.3 Network classes</h3>

      <p><strong>Class A</strong></p>
      <p>
        This Class IP address always has its first bit as 0, next 7 bits as a
        network address and following 24 bits as the host address. This means
        that it allows 2^7 networks and 2^24 hosts per network. The range of IP
        addresses is 0.0.0.0 to 127.255.255.255. This class of IP address is
        used for a very large network. Ex. Big Organisations.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Class B</strong></p>
      <p>
        Class B IP address always has its first bits as 10, next 14 bits as a
        network address and following 16 bits as the host address. This means
        that it allows 2^14 networks and 2^16 hosts per network. The range of IP
        addresses is 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.255.255. This class of IP address is
        used for a medium network like multinational companies.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Class C</strong></p>
      <p>
        Class C IP address always has its first bits as 110, next 21 bits as a
        network address and following 8 bits as the host address. This means
        that it allows 2^21 networks and 2^8 hosts per network. The range of IP
        addresses is the first block from 192.0.0.0 to 192.0.0.255 and the last
        block from 223.255.255.0 to 223.255.255.255. This class is used for a
        small network such as small companies or colleges.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Class D</strong></p>
      <p>
        Class D IP address always has its first bits as 1110. There is no
        segregation of host and network addresses. It allows multicast which
        means a datagram directed to multiple hosts.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Class E</strong></p>
      <p>
        The address begins with 1111. It is reserved for future use, research,
        and development purpose.
      </p>

      <h3>1.4 Network mask</h3>
      <p>
        Subnet mask is a 32-bit number created by setting host bits to all 0s
        and setting network bits to all 1s. In this way, the subnet mask
        separates the IP address into the network and host addresses.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mask specifies how many of network addresses are available for the
        hosts. A subnet mask is like an IP address, but for only internal usage
        within a network. Routers use subnet masks to route data packets to the
        right place. Subnet masks are not indicated within data packets
        traversing the Internet — those packets only indicate the destination IP
        address, which a router will match with a subnet.
      </p>
      <p>
        The “255” address is always assigned to a broadcast address, and the “0”
        address is always assigned to a network address. Neither can be assigned
        to hosts, as they are reserved for these special purposes.
      </p>

      <h3>1.5 Routing table</h3>
      <p>
        It is a set of data stored in router or other network host; stores
        information about routes to other network destinations and about
        arrangements of links and nodes around itself
      </p>

      <h3>1.6 Default gateway</h3>
      <p>
        It is a node in a computer network using the Internet protocol suite
        that serves as the forwarding host (router) to other networks when no
        other route specification matches the destination IP address of a
        packet.
      </p>
      <p>
        Packets are sent here, when their destination does not match addresses
        from the same subnet. It makes it possible for devices in one network to
        communicate with devices in another network. If a computer, for example,
        requests a web page, the request goes through the default gateway before
        exiting the local network (LAN) to reach the internet. We can think of
        it as of an intermediate device between the local network and the
        internet. The default gateway transfers internal data to the internet
        and back again.
      </p>

      <h3>1.7 Broadcast</h3>
      <p>
        The first and last addresses within network, cannot be assigned to
        hosts. They are used for broadcasting - sending packet to all hosts
        within network simultaneously. A special address is required to carry
        out the procedure, which replaces the recipient addresses in question.
        This broadcast IP is of particular use if the addresses of the
        individual network users are not known.
      </p>

      <h3>1.8 Subnet address</h3>
      <p>
        It is a part of IP address and is used to identify a device from a given
        subnetwork within other subnetworks. It allows an autonomous system made
        up of multiple networks to share the same Internet address.
      </p>

      <h3>1.9 Private network address</h3>
      <p>
        It is an IP address of single device inside network. It is assigned to
        all hosts by router, usually using DHCP protocol.
      </p>

      <h3>1.10 Network address translation</h3>
      <p>
        The idea of NAT is to allow multiple devices to access the Internet
        through a single public address. To achieve this, the translation of a
        private IP address to a public IP address is required. Network Address
        Translation (NAT) is a process in which one or more local IP address is
        translated into one or more Global IP address and vice versa in order to
        provide Internet access to the local hosts.
