      <h4>Ethernet Limits</h4>
      <p>
        The shared cable's length is one of the main limitations. The router still requires a physical wire connection, even if we connect via wifi. Ethernet cable consists of four twisted pairs of cables, usually protected by an outer jacket. Even so, there is still a chance that an Ethernet cable will break, stopping the connection.
      </p>
      <p>
        The longer the cable is, the slower the connection is going to be. Thus, its maximal length is approximately 300m.
      </p>
      
      <h4>Ethernet Frame</h4>
      <p>
        Data link layer protocol data unit, uses Ethernet physical layer transport mechanisms. When transmitting data over Ethernet, the Ethernet frame is primarily responsible for the correct rulemaking and successful transmission of data packets. Essentially, data sent over Ethernet is carried by the frame.

      <h3>1.2 MAC Address, Broadcasting</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>MAC Address:</strong> (Media Access Control Address) is a 12-digit hexadecimal number assigned to each device connected to the network. The MAC address, primarily specified as a unique identifier during device manufacturing, is frequently located on the network interface card (NIC) of a device. 
      </p>
      <p>
        A MAC address is required when trying to locate a device or when performing diagnostics on a network device. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The MAC address belongs to the data link layer of the OSI model, which encapsulates the MAC address of the source and destination in the header of each data frame to ensure node-to-node communication.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Broadcasting:</strong> Method of transferring a message to all recipients at the same time. In this all-to-all communication model, every device is sending data to every other device in the network domain.

      <h3>1.3 The Difference Between Hub, Switch, and Router</h3>
      
      <h4>Hub</h4>
      <p>
        <ul>               
          <li>The easiest way to connect two devices in LAN (local area network) using MAC addresses for data transmission.</li>
          <li>Whenever any message is sent to the hub, it is resent to all nodes connected to the network.</li>
          <li>Transferred data: bits / electrical signals</li>
          <li>Hub does not allow the connection to the internet.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      
      <h4>Switches</h4>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>OSI model: data link layer</li>
          <li>Type of hubs; uses packet switching to send and receive data over the network</li>
          <li>They differentiate to which node data packet is sent.</li>
          <li>Connects multiple hosts, can forward a message to a specific host using MAC address</li>
          <li>Transferred data: frames</li>
          <li>Switches are less intensive for the network, but just as hubs don't connect the devices to the internet.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      
      <h4>Routers</h4>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>OSI model: network layer</li>
          <li>Connects two or more packet-switched networks or subnetworks. It manages traffic between these networks by forwarding data packets to their intended IP addresses and allows multiple devices to use the same Internet connection.</li>
          <li>Uses IP address instead of MAC address, analyzes the data up to layer 3, and transfers the data to another router until it arrives at the destination.</li>
          <li>Almost like switches, the only difference is that they can create a connection to the internet or other WAN (wide area network).</li>
        </ul>

      <h3>1.4 CSMA/CD, Collision, Half and Full Duplex</h3>
      <h4>CSMA/CD - Network Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>CSMA/CD:</strong> Creates a procedure that controls how communication occurs in a network over a shared medium.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Carrier Sense:</strong> Makes sure if the medium is now free. When it is, the protocol starts data transmission.</li>
        <li><strong>Multiple Access:</strong> Involves several computers sharing a transmission medium and being connected to the network.</li>
        <li><strong>Collision Detection:</strong> If a collision (multiple devices trying to send data over the medium at the same time) is detected, the participant waits a random interval of time to 'release' the medium and tries to resend the data once more. After 16 tries, the protocol permanently ends the transmission.</li>
        <li><strong>Duplex:</strong> Describes the ability to send and receive data.</li>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Half-duplex:</strong> Unidirectional communication at a given time - data can move in two directions but not at the same time. For example, in CB radio, information is sent and received alternately, resulting in a loss of transfer.</li>
          <li><strong>Full-duplex:</strong> Bidirectional communication at a given time - information is sent in both directions without loss of transfer. For example, in cellular networks or Ethernet.</li>
        </ul>
      </ol>

      <h3>1.5 ARP Request and Detecting Doubled IP Address</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>ARP</strong> (Address Resolution Protocol, operating under DLL) is used to map MAC address to the IP address. It is being achieved by translating 32 bit IP (IPv4) to 48 bit MAC address.
        ARP request is send when MAC address of other device is not known. ARP broadcasts a request packet to all the machines on the LAN and asks if any of the machines are using that particular IP address. When a machine recognizes the IP address as its own, it sends a reply so ARP can update the cache for future reference and proceed with the communication.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Duplicate Address Detection </strong>(DAD) is a mechanism protecting from many IP's (IPv6) being assigned to the same VLAN interface on the switch.
        It verifies that an IPv6 home address is unique on the LAN before the address is assigned to a physical interface. When your system finds an IP conflict, the network interface on one or both ends becomes disabled. This shuts down each device with an affected IP address, disabling functions until the IP address conflict is resolved.

      <h3>1.6 BOOTP, DHCP</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>BOOTP</strong>
         (Bootstrap Protocol) is an internet protocol that lets a network user automatically be configured to receive an IP address and have an operating system booted without user involvement. BOOTP is executed using User Datagram Protocol (UDP) and is the basis for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP).
        <br><br>
        <strong>DHCP</strong>
         (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) is a network protocol used on IP networks where a DHCP server automatically assigns an IP address and other information to each host on the network so they can communicate efficiently with other endpoints.
        <br><br>
        DHCP automatically obtains and assigns IP addresses whereas BOOTP only supports manual configuration. Due to this fact, BOOTP is more prone to errors.</p>

      <h3>1.7 VLANs</h3>
      <p>
          <strong>Virtual Local Area Networks </strong>(VLANs) are used to logically segment a network into multiple broadcast domains. VLANs help in enhancing network security, efficiency, and manageability by isolating traffic between different VLANs. Devices within the same VLAN can communicate with each other as if they are on the same physical network, regardless of their actual physical location.

      <h3>2.1 Find your MAC Address and Default Gateway MAC Address</h3>
      <p>"Physical Address" under the used network adapter describes the MAC address.</p>
      
      <figure>
        <img src="./screenshots/fig1.png" alt="ipconfig command results" />
        <figcaption>Fig. 1. Results of the command 'ipconfig /all'</figcaption>

        <figcaption>Fig. 2. Results of the command 'ping' for the appropriate gateway</figcaption>
      </figure>
      
      <p>
        In the background, we were running Wireshark so that we could get the physical address in the Ethernet II protocol. 
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="./screenshots/fig3.png" alt="MAC address from Wireshark listings" />
        <figcaption>Fig. 3. MAC address from Wireshark listings'</figcaption>
      </figure>
      
      <h3>2.2 Find the producer of your network adapter</h3>
      <p>By visiting a MAC address lookup website and entering the MAC address, we could easily find the manufacturer of the network adapter.</p>
      <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/tools/oui-lookup.html">https://www.wireshark.org/tools/oui-lookup.html</a>
      <p> Using this page we could get the producer of the network adapter. </p>
      
      <figure>

        <figcaption>Fig. 4. OUI search giving the information about the network adapter producer</figcaption>
      </figure>
      
      <h3>2.3 Flush ARP Cache</h3>
      <p>
        In order to delete ARP cache, we had to switch to <em>Administrator: Command Propmt</em>. Firstly we are displaying ARP cache before the procedure 
        using command <em>arp -a</em> command. Than we moved on to flush the ARP cache using command <em>arp -d</em>. To proove that the opertion was successful,
        we displayed the cache.
      </p>

      <h3>2.4 Set the same IP address on two different hosts in the lab and detect it using arp request</h3>
      <p>
        In setting the same IP addresses on two different hosts, firstly, we displayed the IP configuration on the second device.
      </p>    
      <figure> <!--Add photo to the folder-->
        <img src="./screenshots/fig7.png" alt="IP address of the second computer" />
        <figcaption>Fig. 7. Results of <em> config /all</em> command to display IP address of the second computer.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      In <em>Settings</em>, from <em>Advanced network settings > View additional properties</em> we changed the IP configuration.
      <figure> 
        <img src="./screenshots/fig8.png" alt="Settings before IP address changes" />
        <figcaption>Fig. 8. Appropriate section in <em> Settings </em> before the IP address changes.</figcaption>

        <figcaption>Fig. 10. Appropriate section in <em> Settings </em> before the IP address changes.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        As a result, the Internet connection was disabled (but not on the device we taken IP address from).
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="./screenshots/fig11.png" alt="Disabled internet connection after the changes in IP address." />
        <figcaption>Fig. 11. Disabled internet connection after the changes in IP address..</figcaption>
      </figure>
      
      
      <h3>2.5 Using Wireshark save the packets required to obtain IP address through DHCP</h3>
      <p>We reconnected to the eduroam and observed exchange of the packets in Wireshark. We could see that the automatic configuration used the DHCP protocol to assign the IP address. It involves sending Discover, Offer and Request and ACK packets in order to complete the whole process of assigning.</p>
 
      <figure>
        <img src="./screenshots/fig12.png" alt="Wireshark listings of DHCP packets." />
        <figcaption>Fig. 12. Wireshark listings of DHCP packets</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h3>2.6 Release and renew IP address using ipconfig</h3>
      <p>We used the ipconfig /release command to release current IP address</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="./screenshots/fig13.png" alt="Results of ipconfig /release command." />
        <figcaption>Fig. 13. Results of ipconfig /release command</figcaption>
      </figure>
      
      <p>We used the ipconfig /renew command to renew (give a new) IP address.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="./screenshots/fig14.png" alt="Results of ipconfig /renew command." />
        <figcaption>Fig. 14 Results of ipconfig /renew command</figcaption>
      </figure>
      
      <h3>2.7  Change MAC address of a computer in the lab to the same as the MAC address of the other computer in the lab and verify IP address obtained.</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="./screenshots/fig15.png" alt="Changing of the MAC address." />
        <figcaption>Fig. 15. Changing MAC address</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The IP address of the computer is the same as on the previous computer as the DHCP service recognizes a client by the physical address of the network card. To be more precise, it is the DHCP packet (Request) that will specifically request the previously assigned IP address (but there might be a case where the same, previous IP address will not be assigned again).</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="./screenshots/fig16.png" alt="Results of ipconfig /all command showing the MAC and IP addresses." />
        <figcaption>Fig. 16. Results of ipconfig /all command showing the MAC and IP addresses</figcaption>
