      <h3>ISO/OSI model and protocol assignment</h3>

      <p>
        The ISO/OSI model is a conceptual framework used to standardize and
        understand the functions and interactions of network protocols and
        devices. It consists of seven layers, each with specific
        responsibilities to transmit the data.
      </p>

      </figure>

      <h4>Physical Layer (Layer 1):</h4>
      <p>
        This layer deals with the physical medium, such as cables and
        connectors. It is responsible for the transmission and reception of raw
        data bits over a physical medium.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Data Unit:</strong> Bit</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Protocols:</strong> Bluetooth, IEEE 1394, IEEE 802.11, RS-232,
        RS-449, USB
      </p>

      <h4>Data Link Layer (Layer 2):</h4>
      <p>
        This layer is responsible for data framing, error detection, and
        addressing. It ensures reliable point-to-point and point-to-multipoint
        communication over a physical medium.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Data Unit:</strong> Frame</p>
      <p><strong>Protocols:</strong> ARP, L2TP, SLIP</p>

      <h4>Network Layer (Layer 3):</h4>
      <p>
        The network layer handles routing and addressing. It's responsible for
        packet forwarding and addressing using logical addressing (e.g., IP
        addresses).
      </p>
      <p><strong>Data Unit:</strong> Packet</p>
      <p><strong>Protocols:</strong> ICMP, IGMP, IPv4, IPv6</p>
      <h4>Transport Layer (Layer 4):</h4>
      <p>
        The transport layer is responsible for end-to-end communication. It
        provides error detection, flow control, and segmentation and reassembly
        of data.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Data Unit:</strong> Segment</p>
      <p><strong>Protocols:</strong> TCP, UDP</p>

      <h4>Session Layer (Layer 5):</h4>
      <p>
        The session layer establishes, maintains, and terminates connections or
        sessions between applications. It also manages synchronization and
        dialog control.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Data Unit:</strong> Data</p>
      <p><strong>Protocols:</strong> NetBIOS</p>

      <h4>Presentation Layer (Layer 6):</h4>
      <p>
        This layer handles data translation, encryption, and compression,
        ensuring that the data sent and received is in a format that can be
        understood by both parties.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Data Unit:</strong> Data</p>
      <p><strong>Protocols:</strong> SSL, TLS</p>

      <h4>Application Layer (Layer 7):</h4>
      <p>
        The application layer is where end-user applications interact with the
        network. It provides services and interfaces for application-level
        functions like email, file transfer, and remote access.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Data Unit:</strong> Data</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Protocols:</strong> DHCP, DNS, FTP, RTP, HTTP, MIME, NNTP, SIP,
        Telnet
      </p>

        We were running Wireshark during the whole operation. We could see that
        the connection is encrypted, and therefore, we could not see the
        username or password. During the connection, these protocols were used:
        Ethernet II, IPv4, TCP, Transfer Layer Security (TLS, here TLSv1.2).
        Ethernet II belongs to the Physical and Data Link layer, IPv4 - to the
        Network layer, TCP - to the Transport layer, and TLS is in the
        Presentation layer.

        We were running Wireshark during the whole operation. We could see that
        the connection is encrypted as it uses SSHv2 protocol. We could see that
        during the connection Ethernet II, IPv4, TCP, and Secure Shell Protocol
        (SSH, here SSHv2) protocols were used. Ethernet II belongs to the
        Physical and Data Link layer, IPv4 - to the Network layer, TCP - to the
        Transport layer, and SSH belongs to the Application layer.

      <h3>2.8. Explain the protocols used for files transfer.</h3>

      <p>
        The protocols used for file transfer include FTP (File Transfer
        Protocol), which is a standard protocol for transferring files between a
        client and a server. However, it's important to note that FTP does not
        ensure security as it transfers data, including usernames and passwords,
        in plain text. For secure file transfer, it is recommended to use
        protocols such as SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) or FTPS (FTP
        Secure). These secure protocols provide encryption and authentication,
        enhancing the confidentiality and integrity of the transmitted data.
      </p>

      <h3>
        2.9. Explain the rules concerning the files display by the web server
        (default names which block the folder listing display).
      </h3>

      <p>
        Web servers often have default files (e.g., index.html) that are
        displayed when accessing a directory. These default files prevent the
        listing of directory contents and enhance security by only showing
        specific files. Additionally, web servers may have configurations to
        block directory listing for security reasons.
      </p>

      <h3>
        2.10. Display your webpage in the web browser. List the protocols which
        were involved in the files transfer.
      </h3>

      <p>
        To display the webpage in the web browser, various protocols are
        involved, including HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) for transferring
        web pages. Additionally, if secure connections are used, HTTPS (HTTP
        Secure) may be involved, providing a secure and encrypted communication
        channel.
